  - Giving sections a skewed look
  - Using the perspective, and backface-visibility properties to aid in achieving a flipped card effect
  - Using background-blend-mode to add an effect on images
  - Using box-decoration-break to give 1 single HTML element on multiple lines an even amount of padding/background-colour
  - How to wrap text around a circle using shape-outside: circle() and clip-path: circle()
  - Using some basic filters() on hover effects for images to add a nice effect
  - Using multiple pseudo classes & elements, such as :hover, :link, :visited, :active, :focus, :target, :not, :last-child, :checked, ::before, & ::after

  - Understanding the differences between and knowing when to use min-/max-width for media queries
  - Making images responsive through HTML (srcset, media, & sizes attributes) & CSS (min-resolution & min-width to display the best possible version of an image to not hinder performance), and concepts such as Art Direction, Density Switching, & Resolution Switching
  
  
- Using Sass
  - Variables
  - Nesting
  - Mixins
  - Functions
  - Extends
  - 7-1 File Structure & it's benefits
  - Creating our own customer grid using Sass variables, nesting, mixins, the attribute selector, floats, & using the calc() function

  - Using @supports to possibly provide functionality to browsers of the latest CSS properties

- NPM / Node.js

  - Using NPM packages to automatically compile Sass & reload the page using live-server
  - Basic command line commands (Windows) such as dir, cd, ii, clear, md, rd, ni, ri, cp, mv, and del 
  - Creating a simple build process with NPM to compile the Sass code, prefix it, and then compress/minify it
  - Learned how to create a script that watches Sass and runs live-server simultaneously
